# Executive Summary
With over 20 thousand cryptocurrencies to choose from, one of the most common questions asked by new entrants is what to invest in. Mira Finance aims to solve this with index and ETF-style investments for investors, providing broad exposure to crypto assets without the need to pick individual winners. Passive investments that track the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones are the strategy of choice for millions of investors looking for steady market returns. We believe there need to be similar options for crypto investors. 

Mira is built on Aptos & Sui; two new blockchain networks that run on the secure Move programming language originally developed at Meta. With speeds faster than Visa and Mastercard, weâ€™re building scalable and secure smart contracts on networks equipped to support the next 1 billion users.
