# What traction have you received so far?

We won xHack, a hackathon hosted by Wormhole and Jump Capital in Chicago. 

We've made partnerships with a lot of big players, like LayerZero, Axelar, Pontem, Notifi, and more. We've built a strong community of followers and early users on our Discord and Twitter. 

We've managed to build out a powerful product at extremely low cost and slow burn. 

We built multiple fully functional smart contract modules, a fluid UX, an integrated dApp, and a backend server to manage off-chain data in less than two months. After raising 130k, based on our current burn rate, we have ~9 months of runway.
